# Autofuse Use Case Demonstration

## Use Case Function:

Autofuse fuses add + ne two operators.

## Execution Command

```
python3 af_add_ge.py
```

## Expected Execution Result

In the profiling directory under the current directory, there are generated profiling files. In PROF_000001_timestampxx/mindstudio_profiler_output, you can open the op_summary_timestampxx.csv file to see execution operator details. At this point, there is only a kernel named autofused_add_ge_topology_hash, indicating that add+ge two operators have been fused into a single fusion operator.
